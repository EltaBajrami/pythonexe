# Vars for numbers in python are defined as follows

x = 5
type(x)

#Strings declared with single or double quotes

'Hello World' 
"Hello World"

#If you add two strings together they concatenate

'String 1' + 'String 2'
'1' + '1' # Will result in "11"

#If you multiply strings you get that string repeated that much time

'1' * 4 # will result in '1111' string

#Cannot add a string and a num different types
# E.g. '1' + 1 does not work

# BOOLEANS: TRUE OR FALSE Values
# Use the comparsion operator ==
# instead of assigned operator =
